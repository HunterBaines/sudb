Manually set cell at given location to given number.
Usage: stepm ROW COL NUMBER

The two commands "stepm ROW COL NUMBER" and "ROW COL NUMBER" are
equivalent (that is, the "stepm" is optional). Regardless of any
ambiguity, "sm" may be used for "stepm".
(sudb) help break

Usage: break ROW COL

ROW COL indicates the location in the puzzle to break at once the
value of the cell at that location is known.
